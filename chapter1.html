            <h1>Computer System</h1>
            <p>A computer system is an integrated combination of hardware and software that performs computations, processes data, and executes tasks. It consists of multiple components that work together to receive, process, store, and output information.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Components of a Computer System</h2>
            
            <h3>1.1 Hardware</h3>
            <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> Also called the "brain" of the computer, it carries out instructions by performing arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Random Access Memory (RAM) stores temporary data that the CPU needs while executing tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid-State Drives (SSD) are used for long-term data storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices such as keyboards, mice, and scanners allow users to input data.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Monitors, printers, and speakers display or produce the results of computing operations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>1.2 Software</h3>
            <p>Software is the set of programs and operating systems that control the computer hardware and allow users to perform tasks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Includes operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS, which manage hardware resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Includes programs like word processors, web browsers, and media players that help users accomplish specific tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Working of a Computer System</h2>
            <p>A computer operates on the Input-Process-Output (IPO) cycle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> The user provides data through input devices such as a keyboard or mouse.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The CPU processes the input data according to instructions from the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Data is either temporarily stored in RAM or permanently stored in hard drives or SSDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The processed information is displayed on output devices like monitors or printed on paper.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Types of Computer Systems</h2>
            <p>Computer systems are classified based on their size, functionality, and usage:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Personal Computers (PCs):</strong> Commonly used computers designed for personal and office work.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Specialized computers embedded within devices like cars, appliances, and medical equipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Evolution of Computers</h2>
            <p>The development of computers can be divided into five generations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Generation (1940-1956):</strong> Used vacuum tubes and were very large in size.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Generation (1956-1963):</strong> Used transistors, which made them faster and more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Generation (1964-1971):</strong> Used integrated circuits (ICs), which reduced size and improved performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Fourth Generation (1971-Present):</strong> Uses microprocessors, which are compact and highly powerful.</li>
                <li><strong>Fifth Generation (Future):</strong> Focuses on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Importance of Computer Systems</h2>
            <p>Computer systems play a vital role in various fields, such as:</p>
            <ul>
